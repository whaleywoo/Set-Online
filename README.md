## Module 4 Open Ended Project

Tyler Hickey

To run this program, you must install the Godot game engine from this link:
https://godotengine.org/download

The program performs an online game of the card game Set with up to six players. It draws to a screen and
includes keyboard and mouse listeners and timers. It also includes the Godot equivalent of C++ classes,
scenes. It includes a graphics engine that is not a C++ framework (but is built with C++), Godot.

There are no known bugs at the time of submission.

For future work, I could add the ability for players to join and leave between games.

Some of the networking code (Gamestate.gd, Lobby.gd, Lobby.tscn) is based on this demo project under MIT license:

I think I have earned an 80. I expect 10 points to be deducted because of the lifespan penalty,
and I am unsure about the other points because this project was submitted as an exception granted
by the professor so it has no C++ code. It does, however, use many graphical concepts, and includes
keyboard and mouse listeners as well as timer functions. It also contains instanced scenes (the Cards),
which are Godot's equivalent of C++ classes.
